# Regional-Sales-Performance


XYZ Co’s sales data from 2014 through 2018 is analyzed in this project to uncover trends and drivers of revenue and profit. The analysis combines Python-based data processing and visualization with interactive dashboards in Power BI. Key objectives include identifying top-performing products, channels, and regions, understanding year-over-year trends, and delivering actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Project Overview
- **Purpose:** Analyze 5 years of sales data (2014–2018) to identify what drives revenue and profit for XYZ Co.  
- **Scope:** Explore the data across multiple dimensions (products, channels, regions, time) to uncover trends, patterns, and areas for improvement.  
- **Approach:** Perform data cleaning and exploratory analysis in a Jupyter Notebook (Python) and present findings with interactive Power BI dashboards and a summary presentation.

## Problem Statement
XYZ Co aims to optimize its sales strategy by answering questions such as:
- Which products, channels, and regions generate the most revenue and profit?
- How have sales and profits trended over the years, and are there seasonal patterns?
- Where are growth opportunities or weaknesses (e.g., underperforming products or markets)?
- What factors correlate with higher sales and profitability?

The goal is to use data-driven insights to guide marketing, inventory, and sales strategies for higher profitability.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly  
- **MySQL:** Data storage and querying  
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards  
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Excel:** Raw and cleaned dataset
